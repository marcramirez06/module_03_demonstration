# COMPARISON OPERATORS:

# == equality.  Returns True if both operands are equal, false otherwise.
# != inequality. Returns True if operands are not equal, false otherwise.
# < less than. Returns True if first operand is less than second, false otherwise.
# > greater than. Returns True if first operand is greater than second, false otherwise.
# <= less than or equal.Returns True if first operand is less than or equal to second, false otherwise.
# >= greater than or equal. Returns True if first operand is greater than or equal to second, false otherwise.
